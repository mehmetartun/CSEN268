## Lecture 17 - 3 Testing Complex Widget
In this case let's create a complex widget and test it's behavior.

Widgets that we create standalone need a `MaterialApp` to create the widget tree:
```dart
  Widget createWidget(Widget child) {
    return MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(body: child));
  }
```
is a simple wrapper for the individual widget that we are testing.

Let's look at `UserListTile` which displays the user's display name (first name and last name combined) as well as their email and initials in the avatar.
Our test is then defined as:
```dart
  testWidgets('UserListTile Widget Test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(createWidget(
      UserListTile(
          user: User(
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        email: "john@doe.com",
        imageUrl: "https://placehold.co/500x500",
        uid: "1234567890",
      )),
    ));
    expect(find.text('John Doe'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('JD'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('john@doe.com'), findsOneWidget);
  });
```
and running the test we see that:
```zsh
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
00:01 +1: All tests passed!             
```

### Adding cases to your test suite
Let's add a few test cases to ensure that the widget can handle it. For that, let's pass a last name that's empty:
```dart
    await tester.pumpWidget(createWidget(
      UserListTile(
          user: User(
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "",
        email: "john@doe.com",
        imageUrl: "https://placehold.co/500x500",
        uid: "1234567890",
      )),
    ));
    expect(find.text('John'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('J'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('john@doe.com'), findsOneWidget);
```
In this case we would expect the display name to be **John** and the initials to just show **J**. Let's run this and see what we get:
```zsh
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following message was thrown:
Multiple exceptions (4) were detected during the running of the current test, and at least one was
unexpected.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```
We get a few errors. When investigating the output above we note that:
```zsh
══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following RangeError was thrown building UserAvatar:
RangeError (index): Invalid value: Valid value range is empty: 0

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  UserAvatar
  UserAvatar:file:///Users/mehmetartun/Development/csen268/CSEN268-F24/lib/widgets/user_list_tile.dart:13:16
```
This is because our `UserAvatar` doesn't expect strings shorter than 1 for the first name and last name. From [user_avatar.dart](/lib/widgets/user_avatar.dart) we see that it references the first character:
```dart
    return CircleAvatar(
      child: Text(
        '${user.firstName[0].toUpperCase()}${user.lastName[0].toUpperCase()}',
      ),
    );
```
Now with the help of the test result we can rectify this in the next step.
